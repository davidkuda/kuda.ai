**Verse 1:**  
I don't drink coffee, I take tea, my dear  
I like my toast done on one side  
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk  
I'm an Englishman in New York

**Verse 2:**  
See me walking down Fifth Avenue  
A walking cane here at my side  
I take it everywhere I walk  
I'm an Englishman in New York

**Chorus:**  
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  
I'm an Englishman in New York  
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  
I'm an Englishman in New York

**Verse 3:**  
If "manners maketh man" as someone said  
He's the hero of the day  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile  
Be yourself no matter what they say

**Chorus**  

**Bridge:**  
Modesty, propriety  
can lead to notoriety  
You could end up as the only one

Gentleness, sobriety  
are rare in this society  
At night a candle's brighter than the sun

**Verse 4:**  
Takes more than combat gear to make a man  
Takes more than a license for a gun  
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can  
A gentleman will walk but never run

**Verse 5:**  
If "manners maketh man" as someone said  
He's the hero of the day  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile  
Be yourself no matter what they say

*Before and while last chorus, one voice repeats:*  
	*"Be yourself no matter what they say"*

**Chorus:**
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
I'm an Englishman in New York
