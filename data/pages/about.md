### hello and welcome

my name is David, I live in Switzerland.
I am married and father of two wonderful girls.

I am a self-taught programmer, and I enjoy learning how computers work.
[teachyourselfcs.com](www.teachyourselfcs.com) is a fantastic source for CS books.
I program professionally and in my free time.
My favourite programming language is Golang.
I love how the language is minimalistic and simple, how well it performs and is efficient, and how it has you think about concurrency and parallelism (CSP!).
I also love how it compiles to a small, single binary.
I love the terminal, commind-line interfaces and vim.
Privately, I use Mac.
At work, I use linux, sway / Ubuntu.
In 2020, my programming journey began in Python and JavaScript.
I have written a bit of Java and C# in the past.
In Switzerland, many developers love C#, so I have experience in CI/CD with C#.

Before programming, I worked in marketing and sales for about 10 years.

I make music.
You can find a few covers that I published on my YouTube channel: [youtube.com/@davidkuda](https://youtube.com/@davidkuda).
My main instrument is guitar.
But I also enjoy singing and playing the bass.
Additionally, I am a beginner at playing the piano.

Here is music I looped and which had a big influence on my musicmanship:

- Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, Richard Wright (The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals)
- Sting / The Police
- John Scofield (A Go Go), Aaron Parks (Invisible Cinema), Avishai Cohen (At Home, Gently Disturbed)
- Antonio Carlos Jobim (Corcovado, The Girl From Ipanema)
- The Beatles, The Rolling Stones
