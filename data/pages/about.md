### hello and welcome

my name is David, I live in Switzerland.
I am married and father of two wonderful girls.


I program professionally and in my free time.

My favourite programming language is Golang.
I love how the language is minimalistic and simple, how well it performs and is efficient, and how it has you think about concurrency and parallelism (CSP!).
I also love how it compiles to a small, single binary.

I love the terminal, command-line interfaces and vim.
Oh, yes, and I use a split keyboard, [The Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander). :)

In 2020, my programming journey began in Python and JavaScript.
I have written Java and C# in the past.
In Switzerland, many developers love C#, so I have experience in CI/CD with C#.

Nowadays, I do mostly DevOps and SRE type of work.
Most of the code I write are yaml files with inline shell scripts.

The book [https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php] shaped the way I think about software design.
Although I don't write application code so often at work, I still love applying the software design lens to DevOps systems.
In my own words:
I like making systems obvious (i.e. non complex), with an easy interface and deep functionality.

Startups a la YCombinator as in [Do Things That Don't Scale](https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html) or [Sam Altman on How To Start A Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI) and Product Management as described by [Marty Cagan](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-nature-of-product-marty-cagan) fascinate me deeply.

Before programming, I worked in marketing and sales for about 10 years.

I am a self-taught programmer, and I enjoy learning how computers work.
[teachyourselfcs.com](www.teachyourselfcs.com) is a fantastic source for CS books.
Currently, I am working through [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) and [TCP/IP Illustrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated).
I find the internet a fascinating invention.
Currently, I am very excited about computer networking.

Privately, I use Mac.
At work, I use linux (not Arch, btw :)).
I tried Sway, but I couldn't share my screen during calls.
Therefore, I am now using i3.

I make music.
You can find a few covers that I published on my YouTube channel: [youtube.com/@davidkuda](https://youtube.com/@davidkuda).
My main instrument is guitar.
But I also enjoy singing and playing the bass.
Additionally, I am a beginner at playing the piano.

Here is music I looped and which had a big influence on my musicmanship:

- Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, Richard Wright (The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals)
- Sting / The Police
- John Scofield (A Go Go), Aaron Parks (Invisible Cinema), Avishai Cohen (At Home, Gently Disturbed)
- Antonio Carlos Jobim (Corcovado, The Girl From Ipanema)
- The Beatles, The Rolling Stones
