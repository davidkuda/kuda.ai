### hello and welcome
my name is David, I live in Switzerland. I am married to my beautiful wife, Julia, and we are parents of two wonderful daughters. Parenting is by far the hardest thing I have ever done, and I admire people who had success at it for decades. I hope that I will be a good husband and father as much as I can.

I feel very passionate about computer science. I am a self-taught programmer, and I enjoy learning how computers work. I have found many nice books on [teachyourselfcs.com](www.teachyourselfcs.com). I program professionally and in my free time. My faviourite programming language is Golang, and I like Kubernetes a lot, too (distributed systems ftw, right?). My programming journey began in Python and JavaScript in 2020. I have written a bit of Java and C#. In Switzerland, many developers love C#, so I have experience in CI/CD with C#.

I also make music. You can find a few covers that I published on my YouTube channel:
[youtube.com/@davidkuda](https://youtube.com/@davidkuda). My main
instrument is guitar. But I also enjoy singing and playing the bass. Additionally, I am a beginner at playing the
piano.

Here is music I looped and which had a big influence on my musicmanship:

- Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, Richard Wright (The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals)
- Sting / The Police
- Antonio Carlos Jobim (Corcovado, The Girl From Ipanema)
- John Scofield (A Go Go), Aaron Parks (Invisible Cinema), Avishai Cohen (At Home, Gently Disturbed)
- The Beatles, The Rolling Stones
