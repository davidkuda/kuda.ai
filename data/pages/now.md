# Now

Currently, I am building this website. I am thinking a lot about design, and I am looking for great resources to learn more about it.

The first versions were based solely on the CSS framework [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/). I started updating the styles myself. Now I got to the point where I want to learn how to design great web sites. I have the feeling that it's a worthwhile investment.

Finding great resources on CSS and web design is a challenge. I consider buying [EveryLayout](https://every-layout.dev/) or [RefactoringUI](https://www.refactoringui.com/).

On a different notes, I have read [The Millionaire Fastlane](https://www.themillionairefastlane.com/) and found it very fascinating. (The title seems cheesy or clickbaity. Don't let it missguide you, the content is fantastic.) It made me want to "finish" building my personal website, to A) improve the skills needed for building web apps and B) to be ready for the next project. (I don't want to leave this website unfinished.)

I am reading [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/), a book about HTMX. This is a very interesting book. I didn't know that REST was originally thought to exchange hypertext (HTML) and not JSON. Nowadays, the frontend does a lot of work. It gets JSON, builds HTML, and embeds that content on the website. Off-loading the frontend from building HTML and instead sending HTML directly from the backend makes a lot of sense. I can't wait to start using HTMX on this website.
