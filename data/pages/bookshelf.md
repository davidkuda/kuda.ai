## Bookshelf

I do a lot of reading. Mainly in three categories:

1. Computer Science
2. Novels
3. Music Theory

Here, I want to share my thoughts on my reading here.

### Computer Science

#### A Philosophy Of Software Design

Modules should be narrow and deep.


### Novels

#### Harry Potter

I read all the books in 2023 and I had so much fun. My wife read all the books with me, although she had already read them a few times.


### Music Theory

#### Frank Sikora: Jazz-Harmonielehre

I bought this book when I was 17. It was waaaaay too hard for me to understand, especially as a self-taught guitarist without a teacher. I worked with it again in my mid 20s, and many things started clicking.
