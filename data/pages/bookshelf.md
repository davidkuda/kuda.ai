## Bookshelf

I like spending time with books and keep pondering about them.
Here, I'd like to share my thoughts, learnings and recommendations.
I also want to record my reading in reverse-chronological order.


## Currently Reading:

- TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1, 2nd Edition
- The Murderbot Diaries
- Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective


## Recommendations

### A Philosophy Of Software Design

Modules should be deep (a lot of funcitonality), ideally with a small interface.


## Chronology

Tech books are hard to list here, since they take a long time to work on (years).

- **Dune 1** | Frank Herbert | 5/5
- **Artemis** | Andy Weir | 5/5
- **Prometheus: Up And Running (2nd Edition)** | Brian Brazil, Julien Pivotto | 3/5 | I have spent many hours with that book. I have got good at Prometheus, Grafana and PromQL, but on the one hand, I have found the book too difficult at times, and on the other hand, lacking details in a few places, and I was annoyed by all the footnotes. Footnotes are okay, but there were just too many for my taste, I would have either preferred the information to be either left out or within the prose. The section on PromQL read more like a dictionary than a course. I wish it would have been more course-like. Although I found it rather inaccessible, I became a better engineer by working through it, and I gained the ability to help my team with monitoring and alerting. I might have preferred to take Julian Volz's online course instead, though.
