## Bookshelf

I enjoy spending time with books and often find myself reflecting on what Iâ€™ve read.
This space is where I hope to share my thoughts, insights, and recommendations.
Iâ€™m not sure yet how Iâ€™ll go about itâ€”letâ€™s see. (Under construction ðŸ™‚)
Itâ€™s also a place to keep track of my reading journey.


### Currently Reading

- Hypermedia Systems
- TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1, 2nd Edition (takes years ... :) )
- Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective (takes years, too ... :) )


### Recommendations

**A Philosophy Of Software Design** (John Ousterhout). This book has had a very big influence on the way I think about software design. One of my favourite insights: _"Modules should be deep (a lot of funcitonality), ideally with a small interface."_

**Let's Go** (Alex Edwards). This does explain fairly little about Go (e.g. no explanation on concurrency model, interfaces, etc.), but it is an excellent course on how to build HTTP servers or backends in Golang. This has been a very (very) useful resource. In fact, I have built this website initially by following along Let's Go :)

Tech books are hard to list here, since they take a long time to work on (years).

- **Dune 1** | Frank Herbert | 5/5
- **Artemis** | Andy Weir | 5/5
- **Prometheus: Up And Running (2nd Edition)** | Brian Brazil, Julien Pivotto | 3/5 | I have spent many hours with that book. I have got good at Prometheus, Grafana and PromQL, but on the one hand, I have found the book too difficult at times, and on the other hand, lacking details in a few places, and I was annoyed by all the footnotes. Footnotes are okay, but there were just too many for my taste, I would have either preferred the information to be either left out or within the prose. The section on PromQL read more like a dictionary than a course. I wish it would have been more course-like. Although I found it rather inaccessible, I became a better engineer by working through it, and I gained the ability to help my team with monitoring and alerting. I might have preferred to take Julian Volz's online course instead, though.
