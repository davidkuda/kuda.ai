## Bookshelf

My reading is mainly in three categories: Computer Science, Novels, Music Theory. Here, I'd like to record my reading in chronological order, give recommendations, and share thoughts.

## Recommendations

### A Philosophy Of Software Design

Modules should be narrow (small interface) deep (a lot of funcitonality).


## Chronology

### 2024

- **Dune 1** | Frank Herbert | 5/5.
- **Artemis** | Andy Weir | 5/5.
- **Prometheus: Up And Running (2nd Edition)** | Brian Brazil, Julien Pivotto | 3/5. I have spent many hours with that book. I have got good at Prometheus, Grafana and PromQL, but on the one hand, I have found the book too difficult at times, and on the other hand, lacking details in a few places, and I was annoyed by all the footnotes. Footnotes are okay, but there were just too many for my taste, I would have either preferred the information to be either left out or within the prose. The section on PromQL read more like a dictionary than a course. I wish it would have been more course-like. Although I found it rather inaccessible, I became a better engineer by working through it, and I gained the ability to help my team with monitoring and alerting. I might have preferred to take Julian Volz's online course instead, though.

### 2023

**Harry Potter.** 5/5. I read all seven Harry Potter books in 2023 and I had so much fun. My wife read all the books with me, although she had already read them a few times.
