# kuda.ai | My Personal Website

I am running a website already, [kuda.ai](https://kuda.ai). It is [written](https://github.com/davidkuda/blog-kuda-ai) with NextJS and React, and it is deployed via Vercel. This project is a rewrite of the previous website.

Why rewriting my personal website?

- While the Vercel deployment has great DevEx, it hides a lot of the deployment know-how from you. My interest in networking and server management increased, so I would like to do it myself to understand how the bits shift.
- NextJS is a great tool, but my website is so simple, I don't need such sharp tools.
- As backend, I use contentful. Contentful is great, but I want to do it myself.
- Once everything is on my server, I have no limitations in flexibility.
- I enjoy programming in Go.
