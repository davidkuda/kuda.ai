# kuda.ai | My Personal Website

This repo is the code for my personal website.
Visit [https://kuda.ai](https://kuda.ai) to see it in your browser.
To build it, I read the fantastic book [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards.

The previous version is here: [https://old.kuda.ai](https://old.kuda.ai).
It is [written](https://github.com/davidkuda/blog-kuda-ai) in JavaScript with NextJS and React, and it is deployed via Vercel.
