# kuda.ai | My Personal Website

This repo is a rewrite of my personal website.

The first and current version is here: [https://kuda.ai](https://kuda.ai).
It is [written](https://github.com/davidkuda/blog-kuda-ai) in JavaScript with NextJS and React, and it is deployed via Vercel.

This new version is previewable at [new.kuda.ai](https://new.kuda.ai).

Unfortunately, I have little time to invest in this project, so the progress is rather slow. This also means that I barely write any blog posts.

Why rewriting my personal website?

- Creative Expression.
- Learning: While the Vercel deployment has great DevEx, it hides a lot of the deployment know-how from you. My interest in networking and server management increased, so I would like to do it myself to understand how the bits shift.
- As backend, I use contentful. Contentful is fantastic, but I want to do it myself. For fun and learning.
- I enjoy programming in Go.
